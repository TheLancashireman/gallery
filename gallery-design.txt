index.html is created by hand.

HTML files for image indexes and themes are created by script using template
file gallery-index-html.tmpl and a description file.

The description file contains:

Title: <gallery title>          - page title in HTML head
Header: <gallery header>        - header line for gallery's main page
Filename: <filename>            - name of HTML file relative to gallery-root



Image: <filename>               - File name of photo relative to HTML file.
Image: <another filename>
...etc.

Each Image: line can be followed by:
Thumb: <thumbnail file name>
Caption: <caption for image>
(others?)
--- at most one line of each type.

Blank lines and lines starting with # are ignored.

The gallery template expects:

* $gallery_title
* $gallery_header
* $n_images
* @images
* @thumbs

To do: captions etc.

Example gallery file:

Title: Broken boats
Header: Broken boats
Filename: BrokenBoats.html
